# Wordle Clone

A clone of the popular game Wordle.\
Demo: [https://heiinhei911.github.io/wordle_clone](https://heiinhei911.github.io/wordle_clone)

## How to Play

Once the app has loaded, you will see a 5 by 6 grid and a on-screen keyboard.

To start playing, type a five-letter English word (special words such as names are not allowed) using the on-screen keyboard. As you start typing, each character that you type will be displayed on the grid.\
Once you have a guess, press the "ENTER" key on the keyboard to check if your guess matches any character of the hidden part.

- If one of your character in your guess is part of the hidden word but is not in the correct position, the tile will turn yellow.
- If one of your character in your guess is part of the hidden word AND is in the correct position, the tile will turn green.
- If one of your character in your guess is not part of the hidden at all, the tile will turn gray.

Finally, if you manage to guess the hidden word with 6 or less tries, you win!

Have fun!
