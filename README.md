# Wordle Clone

A clone of the popular game Wordle.\
Demo: [https://heiinhei911.github.io/wordle_clone](https://heiinhei911.github.io/wordle_clone)

## How to Play

Once you are in the website, you will see a 5 by 6 grid and a on-screen keyboard.

To start playing, click any key on the keyboard to make a five-letter English word.\
Once you have a guess, click on the "ENTER" key on keyboard to check if your guess matches any character of the hidden part.

If one of your character in your guess is part of the hidden word but is not in the correct position, the tile will turn yellow.\
If one of your character in your guess is part of the hidden word AND is correct position, the tile will turn green.\
If one of your character in your guess is not part of the hidden at all, the tile will turn gray.

Finally, if you manage to guess the hidden word with 6 or less tries, you win the game!

Have fun!
